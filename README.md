# Caching with Redis

I'm trying to learn more about caching a how it can be achieved using .NET.

This project uses Redis and the `IDistributedCache` interface. 

I've implemented two caching strategies in this application:

1. Cache Aside
2. Write Through

I'm just exploring the strategies and APIs, so the code is not great.
